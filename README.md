# 🇲🇾 **CutiCuti Malaysia**

*CutiCuti Malaysia* is an interactive, **map-based exploration game** where players virtually travel across Malaysia. Players begin by selecting a **starting state (initial origin)**, where they establish a personal **farm**. From this origin point, players light up the roads to reach **tourism-value destinations** and **cultural sites**.

As players explore, they unlock:

* **Tangible heritage** — monuments, buildings, landscapes
* **Intangible heritage** — traditions, festivals, local stories

Alongside exploration, players can **plant, harvest, and trade crops** on their farm. Friends can visit each other’s farms and **steal vegetables**, adding a fun, social twist.

By progressing in the game, players earn **coins** and complete **milestones** that can be redeemed not only for virtual travel tickets but also for **real-world rewards** such as travel vouchers, tourism discounts, and special offers through partnerships with official tourism bodies.
