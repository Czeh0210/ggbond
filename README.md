**CutiCuti Malaysia**
is an interactive, map-based exploration game where players virtually travel across Malaysia. Players begin by selecting a starting state (initial origin), where they establish a personal farm. From this origin point, players light up the roads to reach tourism-value destinations and cultural sites. As players explore, they unlock tangible heritage (such as monuments, buildings, and landscapes) and intangible heritage (including traditions, festivals, and local stories). Alongside exploration, players can plant, harvest, and trade crops on their farm. Friends can visit each other’s farms and steal vegetables, adding a fun, social twist. By progressing in the game, players earn coins and complete milestones that can be redeemed not only for virtual travel tickets but also for real-world rewards such as travel vouchers, tourism discounts, and special offers through partnerships with official tourism bodies.

🎯 Purpose of the Game
- Promote awareness of Malaysia’s rich cultural, natural, and tourism heritage.
- Support national tourism campaigns by linking gameplay to real-world destinations.
- Encourage social interaction and community building.
- Reward players with both virtual and physical travel-related prizes, such as vouchers or tourism packages, through collaboration with official tourism bodies.

⚡ Challenges and Approaches
🕒 Ensuring User Sustainability
Challenge: Keeping players engaged over time through daily gameplay without overwhelming them.
Approach:
- Introduced daily refreshed light-up chances to encourage players to return regularly and build a habit.
- Integrated the farm mode as a parallel activity where users can plant, harvest, and trade,offering variety beyond just map exploration.
- Designed the farming system and social interactions (e.g., stealing friends’ vegetables) to add fun competition and promote daily logins.

🤝 Promoting Community and Social Visibility
Challenge: Making the game feel vibrant, visible, and community-driven.
Approach:
- Enabled friend system features — players can add friends and interact by visiting or stealing vegetables, creating playful connections.
- Developed community-based mechanics to encourage visibility of player progress and motivate friendly competition and sharing.
- Social features serve to strengthen user sustainability through organic promotion and peer engagement.

⚖️ Balancing Exploration and Farming
Challenge: Ensuring both map exploration and farming feel meaningful and enjoyable without one overshadowing the other.
Approach:
- Linked farming rewards (coins) to exploration progress, ensuring both contribute toward travel milestones.
- Avoided overloading players with complex features like quizzes, which could feel like an exam rather than a game.
- Made heritage content unlock progressively — information about monuments, traditions, and festivals is revealed piece by piece as users explore, so that learning feels like a reward rather than a chore.
